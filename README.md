# Personal Website [OLD]

This repo hosts all the code used to make my personal website wich you can check out [here](https://goncalomano.com)
Some technologies used so far are **react** , **bootstrap** , **gsap** and **scrollmagic**
I'm trying to make this portfolio as costumized as possible to show my criativity and possibly land a nice job one day :)
